## RaylibRaycaster

#### A simple raycaster project ported from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA) great c opengl tutorial to c++ powered by Raylib. 

This project was meant for me to learn a thing or two about raycasting and old school 3D rendering. Also it is just a fun side project to mess around with.
